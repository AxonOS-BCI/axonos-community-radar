# Changelog

All notable changes to the Open BCI Ecosystem Radar are documented here.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Relevance filtering** in `scripts/radar.py`: a repository is kept only if it carries
  a core BCI/neuro topic, or a context topic plus a neuro keyword — keeping generic
  projects (VPNs, password managers, generic embedded) off the radar.
- **Deterministic scoring**: recency is measured from a fixed 6-hour snapshot slot, so
  unchanged projects keep a stable position between refreshes (no "jumping").
- **Change tracking**: a stable `first_seen` per project and an `is_new` flag, surfaced
  as `NEW` badges, a **New** filter, and an `is_new` ring on the radar.
- **Stats bar**: projects, new-this-week, active-30d, total stars, categories.
- **Premium project cards** grid alongside the radar, with category pills and activity.
- **RSS feed** (`feed.xml`) of newly discovered projects, plus an `<link rel=alternate>`.
- **Rate-limit handling** (403/429 + `X-RateLimit-Reset`) with bounded backoff.
- **Tests** (`tests/test_radar.py`) for relevance, categorisation, determinism, safety.
- **SECURITY.md** and a Content-Security-Policy.

### Changed
- Radar centering is now CSS-driven (square via `aspect-ratio`, buffer sized from the
  real canvas rect) and readability overhauled (coloured sectors, glowing dots, legible
  ring labels), replacing the parent-width math that caused a right-shift.
- Output `data/radar.json` is now self-validated before write.

### Security
- All repo-derived text is HTML-escaped; links restricted to `https://github.com/…`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-24
- Initial public release: interactive radar, public auto-refreshed data, contribution funnel.
